Welcome to the website of the **1st workshop on Computer Vision Aided Architectural Design (CVAAD)**. 
We are delighted that our workshop was hosted at [the International Conference on Computer Vision](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/) (ICCV) in Paris, 2023.


## About the workshop

The workshop aims at expanding the interdisciplinary domain of computer vision in architectural design, encouraging collaboration, and investigating common research interests. 
By showcasing datasets and applications from architectural design, the workshop creates opportunities for computer vision researchers. 
Through keynote talks, discussions, and a workshop challenge, attendees explored relevant topics from both generative and analytic computer vision for the applications and processes in architectural design. 
This shed light on the needs, constraints, and challenges associated with developing and implementing effective computer vision tasks and methods in architectural design and research. 
The workshop consists of the following:

- [Invited speakers](/keynotes/)
- [Papers and posters](/papers/)
- [Competition: floor plan generation](/competition/)

The schedule can be found [here](/schedule/).
