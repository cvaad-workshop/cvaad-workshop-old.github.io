### [Seyran Khademi](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/people/seyran-khademi)

Since April 2021, Seyran Khademi is an Assistant Professor at the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE) and the co-director of AiDAPT lab (AI for Design, Analysis, and Optimization in Architecture and the Built Environment). She is working as an interdisciplinary researcher between Computer Vision lab and Architecture Department at ABE. Her research interest lies at the intersection of Data, Computer Vision and Deep Learning in the context of man-made imagery including illustrations and visual data for Architectural Design. In 2020 she was honored to be the research in residence fellow at the Royal Library of the Netherlands working on visual recognition for children’s book collection. In 2017 she was appointed as an postdoctoral researcher at Computer vision lab working on the ArchiMediaL project, regarding the automatic detection of buildings and architectural elements in visual data focusing on Computer Vision and Deep Learning methods for archival data and street-view imagery. Seyran received her Ph.D. in signal processing and optimization in 2015 from TU Delft, followed by postdoctoral research on Intelligent Audio and Speech algorithms. She received her MSc. degree in Signal Processing from the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2010 and her BSc degree in telecommunications from the University of Tabriz in Iran.

### [Jan van Gemert](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/people/jan-van-gemert)
Jan van Gemert received a PhD degree from the University of Amsterdam in 2010. There he was a post-doctoral fellow as well as at École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Currently he leads the Computer Vision lab at Delft University of Technology. He teaches the Deep learning and Computer Vision MSc courses. His research focuses on visual inductive priors for deep learning for automatic image and video understanding. He published over 75 peer-reviewed papers with more than 5,000 citations.

<!--- IRO --->

### [Iro Armeni](https://profiles.stanford.edu/iro-armeni?releaseVersion=10.5.2)
Iro Armeni will be Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering in autumn of 2023. She is interested in interdisciplinary research between Architecture, Civil Engineering, and Visual Machine Perception. Iro focuses on developing quantitative and data-driven methods that learn from real-world visual data to generate, predict, and simulate new or renewed built environments that place the human in the center. Iro's goal is to create sustainable, inclusive, and adaptive built environments that can support our current and future physical and digital needs. As part of her research vision, she is particularly interested in creating spaces that blend from the 100% physical (real reality) to the 100% digital (virtual reality) and anything in between, with the use of Mixed Reality.


Iro completed her PhD at Stanford University on August 2020, Civil and Environmental Engineering Department, with a PhD minor at the Computer Science Department. Afterwards she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at ETH Zurich working at both the Computer Science and Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering Departments (2023). Prior to her PhD, she received an MSc in Computer Science (Ionian University-2013), an MEng in Architecture and Digital Design (University of Tokyo-2011), and a Diploma in Architectural Engineering (National Technical University of Athens-2009). She has also worked as an architect and consultant for both the private and public sector.

Iro is the recipient of the ETH Zurich Postdoctoral Fellowship, the Google PhD Fellowship, and the MEXT Scholarship.

### [Fatemeh Mostafavi](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/f.mostafavi/?cHash=db57104f8776c2a1522b91c039845e84)

Fatemeh Mostafavi is a Ph.D. researcher at AiDAPT lab, in TU Delft faculty of Architecture and Built Environment. Specialized in energy efficient and environmental building design, she seeks to apply computer vision techniques to big data in architecture. In her research, architecture and computer science intersect. At this intersection, she aims to develop an AI-based building design tool that incorporates building micro-climatic context and environmental factors such as daylight, natural ventilation, view, and noise. In addition, she intends to expand current architectural datasets and build a foundation for developing an environmentally rich dataset of residential buildings in the Netherlands’ climatic context.

### [Casper van Engelenburg](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/c.c.j.vanengelenburg/?cHash=a72f1da92639fa8301893a08d4b49da1)

Architects communicate their designs through various visual abstractions of the physical space; including orthographic drawings, photos, and 3D models. Semantic similarity learning for architectural drawings is a PhD project of Casper van Engelenburg that started in October 2021, focusing on understanding visual patterns in floorplan image data. He develops deep contrastive learning frameworks that enable us to learn low-dimensional, task-agnostic representations of architectural drawings. This research line builds a foundation for large quantitative analysis of archival and linked visual data. Besides theoretical work, his aim is to connect it to the practice by enhancing Architectural-specific search engines.
