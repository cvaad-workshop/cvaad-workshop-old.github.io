We cordinally invite researchers to submit papers related to the topics of the workshop. Topics include, but are not limited to:

- **Re-thinking computer vision tasks for architectural design**: What type of laborious tasks in design can be automated using computer vision models? 
_Example works_: floor plan generation; 2D / 3D reconstruction of buildings; architectural element recognition.

- **Re-thinking deep learning datasets for architectural visual data including architectural drawings and 3D models**: What is the status of benchmark datasets of visual data in architectural design? What are the main bottlenecks to developing trustworthy datasets? 
_Examples works_: [RPLAN](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html), [Google Landmarks](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark), [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/record/7070952), [CubiCasa5K](https://github.com/CubiCasa/CubiCasa5k), [AmsterTime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16291).

- **Re-thinking model architectures of computer vision such as convolutional neural networks to adapt to the novel visual data in architectural design**: What type of neural networks and training frameworks are needed to capture the semantics and compositional relations from architectural-specific data? 
_Example works_: graph neural networks, convolutional neural networks, transformers, self-supervised learning, similarity learning, transfer learning.
