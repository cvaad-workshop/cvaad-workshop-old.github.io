We cordinally invite researchers to submit papers related to the topics of the workshop. Topics include, but are not limited to:

<!---
- Re-thinking computer vision tasks for architectural design: What type of laborious tasks in design can be automated using computer vision models?

- Re-thinking deep learning datasets for architectural visual data including architectural drawings and 3D models. What is the status of benchmark datasets of visual data in architectural design? What are the main bottlenecks to developing trustworthy datasets?

- Re-thinking model architectures of computer vision such as convolutional neural networks to adapt to the novel visual data in architectural design. What type of neural networks are needed to capture the semantics and compositional relations in architectural drawings?

###### Re-thinking computer vision tasks for architectural design

What type of laborious tasks in design can be automated using computer vision models? _Examples_: floor plan generation; 2D / 3D reconstruction of buildings; architectural element recognition.

###### Re-thinking deep learning datasets for architectural visual data including architectural drawings and 3D models

What is the status of benchmark datasets of visual data in architectural design? What are the main bottlenecks to developing trustworthy datasets?
_Examples_: [RPLAN](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~fuxm/projects/DeepLayout/index.html), [Google Landmarks](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/google-landmark), [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/record/7070952), [CubiCasa5K](https://github.com/CubiCasa/CubiCasa5k), [AmsterTime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16291).

###### Re-thinking model architectures of computer vision such as convolutional neural networks to adapt to the novel visual data in architectural design

What type of neural networks and training frameworks are needed to capture the semantics and compositional relations from architectural-specific data? _Examples_: graph neural networks, convolutional neural networks, transformers, self-supervised learning, similarity learning, transfer learning.
