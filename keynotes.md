The following keynote speakers have confirmed.

### [Alexei A. Efros](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/)

Alexei (Alyosha) Efros is a professor at EECS Department at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), where he is part of the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR)](http://bair.berkeley.edu/). Before that, he spent a decade on the faculty of the [Robotics Institute](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/). He is also still remembered in [lovely Oxford](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/people.html), where he did a post-doc with [Andrew Zisserman](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az). Starting in 2007, he has also been closely collaborating with [Team WILLOW](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) at [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) / [INRIA](https://flic.kr/s/aHsju3GuLK) in beautiful Paris.

### [Matthias Strandfest](https://standfest.science/)

Matthias Standfest is an architect with main interests directed towards understanding the geometric impact on architecture performance models using machine learning methods. He received his Ph.D. from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with Dr. Gerhard Schmitt and as a guest at [FCL](https://fcl.ethz.ch/) Singapore with [Prof. Dr. Ludger Hovestadt](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/organisation/who-is-who/arch/details.OTYyMTY=.TGlzdC8xOTA1LC0xMzE3NTA2NzE5.html), he has balanced method development for mesh-based deep learning techniques with the application of these tools to predict urban simulation results in real-time. He is the curator of [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/record/7070952) — the World's largest dataset of apartment models including aggregated geolocation-based simulation results covering viewshed, natural light, traffic noise, centrality, and geometric analysis.
