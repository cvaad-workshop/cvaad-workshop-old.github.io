The following keynote speakers have confirmed.

### [Alexei A. Efros](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/)

Alexei (Alyosha) Efros is a professor at EECS Department at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/), where he is part of the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab (BAIR)](http://bair.berkeley.edu/). Before that, he spent a decade on the faculty of the [Robotics Institute](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/). He is also still remembered in [lovely Oxford](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/people.html), where he did a post-doc with [Andrew Zisserman](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az). Starting in 2007, he has also been closely collaborating with [Team WILLOW](http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/) at [École Normale Supérieure](http://www.ens.fr/) / [INRIA](https://flic.kr/s/aHsju3GuLK) in beautiful Paris. He has co-authored several seminal papers in computer vision including [Pix2Pix](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/html/Isola_Image-To-Image_Translation_With_CVPR_2017_paper.html) and [Cycle GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593) as well as inspiring work on “[what makes Paris look like Paris](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/whatMakesParis/)”!

### [Noah Snavely](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/)

Dr. Noah Snavely is an associate professor in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu/) interested in computer vision and computer graphics, and a member of the [Cornell Graphics and Vision Group](http://rgb.cs.cornell.edu/). He also works at Google Research in NYC. His research interests are in computer vision and graphics, particularly in 3D understanding and depicting scenes from images. He is the recipient of a PECASE, a Microsoft New Faculty Fellowship, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award.

### [Francis Engelmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/people-atoz/person-detail.Mjk1NTc0.TGlzdC8zMDQsLTIxNDE4MTU0NjA=.html)

Dr. Francis Engelmann is a PostDoctoral Researcher at ETH Zurich with Prof. [Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/), and a visiting researcher at Google Zurich. Francis' research focuses on large-scale 3D scene understanding for modeling interactive spaces and generating novel environments. Previously, he completed his PhD in computer science under the supervision of Prof. [Bastian Leibe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZcULDB0AAAAJ&hl=de) at the [computer vision group](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/) of [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1). His research has been recognized through the ETH Zurich Career Seed Award and the ETH AI Center Postdoctoral Fellowship.

### [Matthias Strandfest](https://standfest.science/)

Matthias Standfest is an architect with main interests directed towards understanding the geometric impact on architecture performance models using machine learning methods. He received his Ph.D. from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with Dr. Gerhard Schmitt and as a guest at [FCL](https://fcl.ethz.ch/) Singapore with [Prof. Dr. Ludger Hovestadt](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/organisation/who-is-who/arch/details.OTYyMTY=.TGlzdC8xOTA1LC0xMzE3NTA2NzE5.html), he has balanced method development for mesh-based deep learning techniques with the application of these tools to predict urban simulation results in real-time. He is the curator of [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/record/7070952) — the World's largest dataset of apartment models including aggregated geolocation-based simulation results covering viewshed, natural light, traffic noise, centrality, and geometric analysis.
