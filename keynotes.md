We had the priviledge of hosting a diverse group of engaging speakers:

### [Noah Snavely](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/)

Dr. Noah Snavely is an associate professor in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu/) interested in computer vision and computer graphics, and a member of the [Cornell Graphics and Vision Group](http://rgb.cs.cornell.edu/). He also works at Google Research in NYC. His research interests are in computer vision and graphics, particularly in 3D understanding and depicting scenes from images. He is the recipient of a PECASE, a Microsoft New Faculty Fellowship, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award.

### [Daniel Aliaga](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/)

Daniel Aliaga holds BS in Computer Science, honors thesis (with Andy van Dam) and magna cum laude, from Brown University. Subsequently, obtained a MS (with Henry Fuchs) and a PhD degree (with Anselmo Lastra, Fred Brooks, and Dinesh Manocha) in Computer Science from UNC Chapel Hill. Worked at Nokia/Lucent/AT\&&T Bell Labs (with Ingrid Carlbom) and at Princeton University as a researcher (with Tom Funkhouser). He joined Purdue in 2003, co-founding the Computer Graphics and Visualization Laboratory (CGVLAB). Dr. Aliaga has held visiting professor positions at ETH Zurich Information Architecture and also ETH Computer Science, INRIA Sophia-Antipolis, and KAUST in Saudi Arabia. After finishing high school (Colegio Santa Maria), Daniel immigrated from Lima, Peru and is the first in his family and relatives to hold a PhD.

### [Francis Engelmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/people-atoz/person-detail.Mjk1NTc0.TGlzdC8zMDQsLTIxNDE4MTU0NjA=.html)

Dr. Francis Engelmann is a PostDoctoral Researcher at ETH Zurich with Prof. [Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/), and a visiting researcher at Google Zurich. Francis' research focuses on large-scale 3D scene understanding for modeling interactive spaces and generating novel environments. Previously, he completed his PhD in computer science under the supervision of Prof. [Bastian Leibe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZcULDB0AAAAJ&hl=de) at the [computer vision group](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/) of [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1). His research has been recognized through the ETH Zurich Career Seed Award and the ETH AI Center Postdoctoral Fellowship.

### [Matthias Strandfest](https://standfest.science/)

Matthias Standfest is an architect with main interests directed towards understanding the geometric impact on architecture performance models using machine learning methods. He received his Ph.D. from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with Dr. Gerhard Schmitt and as a guest at [FCL](https://fcl.ethz.ch/) Singapore with [Prof. Dr. Ludger Hovestadt](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/organisation/who-is-who/arch/details.OTYyMTY=.TGlzdC8xOTA1LC0xMzE3NTA2NzE5.html), he has balanced method development for mesh-based deep learning techniques with the application of these tools to predict urban simulation results in real-time. He is the curator of [Swiss Dwellings](https://zenodo.org/record/7070952) â€” the World's largest dataset of apartment models including aggregated geolocation-based simulation results covering viewshed, natural light, traffic noise, centrality, and geometric analysis.
