The floor plan auto-completion task takes as input the boundary of a building, the structural elements necessary for the building's structural integrity, and a set of user constraints formalized in a graph structure, with the goal to automatically generate the full floor plan. While previous research on floor plan generation has mainly focused on the scale of individual apartments, our challenge sets the stage for floor plan generation at a larger scale: the scale of the apartment complex. With the help of [Archylise](https://www.archilyse.com/), we developed [Modified Swiss Dwellings: a ML-ready Dataset for Floor Plan Auto-Completion at Scale](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/e1d89cb5-6872-48fc-be63-aadd687ee6f9) which will be used for the challenge.
